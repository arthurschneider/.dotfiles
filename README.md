### Collection of my dotfiles

#### Usage
 First step is to download the files.  
 Go to your home directory and run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:arthurschneider/.dotfiles.git
```


After that step you need to run the install.sh script.  
Run these commands
```bash
cd .dotfiles
./install.sh
```
>This script will set symbolic links and clone oh-my-zsh plugin.  
>So the dotfiles will remain in the .dotfiles directory.
