##### Collection of my dotfiles

</br>
#### Usage
 First step is to download the files.  
 Go to your home directory and run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:arthurschneider/.dotfiles.git
```


After that step you need to run the setup_dotfiles.sh script.  
Run these commands
```bash
cd .dotfiles
./setup_dotfiles.sh
```
>This script will set symbolic links.  
>So the dotfiles will remain in the .dotfiles directory.

At the end you need to activate the aliases and themes by:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
